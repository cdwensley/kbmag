<Abstract>
The &KBMAG; package for &GAP;4 provides an interface to some `C' programs 
for running the Knuth-Bendix completion program on finite semigroup, 
monoid or group presentations, and for attempting to compute  automatic 
structures of finitely presented groups. 
<P/>
The latest version is &KBMAGVERSION; of &KBMAGLONGRELEASEDATE;.  
<P/>
Bug reports, comments, suggestions for additional features, 
and offers to implement some of these, will all be very welcome. 
<P/>
Please submit any issues at
